// Applies committed Prisma migrations at deploy time.
//
// - No DATABASE_URI (e.g. a preview build without a DB): skip cleanly so the build
//   still succeeds.
// - DATABASE_URI present: run `prisma migrate deploy`, which applies ONLY the
//   reviewed migration files in prisma/migrations. Unlike `prisma db push` it never
//   diffs-and-drops, so it is safe against production data. A failure aborts the
//   build on purpose — shipping app code against an un-migrated schema is worse
//   than a failed deploy.
//
// Self-healing baseline: this project's database was originally created with
// `prisma db push` (tables but no migration history), so the first `migrate deploy`
// returns P3005 ("schema is not empty"). When that happens we baseline the initial
// migration (mark 0_init applied WITHOUT re-running it) and retry — which then
// applies only the genuinely new migrations. This branch only triggers on an
// already-populated database; a fresh/empty DB takes the success path on the first
// try, so we never skip creating tables on a new database.
//
// Data backfills/self-heals are intentionally NOT run here — they live in
// `npm run db:maintenance` and are run deliberately by an operator. Content seeding
// is likewise NOT run on every deploy (it would overwrite CMS edits); seed manually
// with `SEED_FORCE=1 npm run seed` when you deliberately want inventory.json to win.
